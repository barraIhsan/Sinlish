        My daughter, Jane, never
        dreamed of receiving a letter
        from a girl of her own age in
        Holland. Last year, we were
        traveling across the Channel
        and Jane put a piece of paper
        with her name and address on
        it into a bottle. She threw the
        bottle into the sea. She never
        thought of it again, but ten
        month later, she received a
        letter from a girl in Holland.
        Both girls write to each other
        regularly now. However, they
        have decided to use the post
        office. Letters will cost a little
        more, but they will certainly
        travel faster. </string>
