    <string name="a_glass_envelope">"My daughter, Jane, never\ndreamed of receiving a letter\nfrom a girl of her own age in\nHolland. Last year, we were\ntraveling across the Channel\nand Jane put a piece of paper\nwith her name and address on\nit into a bottle. She threw the\nbottle into the sea. She never\nthought of it again, but ten\nmonth later, she received a\nletter from a girl in Holland.\nBoth girls write to each other\nregularly now. However, they\nhave decided to use the post\noffice. Letters will cost a little\nmore, but they will certainly\ntravel faster."</string>
